Analysis Description
--------------------
MEME (Mixed Effects Model of Evolution) estimates a site-wise synonymous
(&alpha;) and a two-category mixture of non-synonymous (&beta;-, with
proportion p-, and &beta;+ with proportion [1-p-]) rates, and uses a
likelihood ratio test to determine if &beta;+ > &alpha; at a site. The
estimates aggregate information over a proportion of branches at a site,
so the signal is derived from episodic diversification, which is a
combination of strength of selection [effect size] and the proportion of
the tree affected. A subset of branches can be selected for testing as
well, in which case an additional (nuisance) parameter will be inferred
-- the non-synonymous rate on branches NOT selected for testing.
Multiple partitions within a NEXUS file are also supported for
recombination - aware analysis. Version 3.0 adds a different format for
ancestral state reconstruction, branch-site posterior storage, and
site-level heterogeneity testing.
