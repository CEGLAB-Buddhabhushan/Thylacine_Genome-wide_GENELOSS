Analysis Description
--------------------
FEL (Fixed Effects Likelihood) estimates site-wise synonymous (&alpha;)
and non-synonymous (&beta;) rates, and uses a likelihood ratio test to
determine if beta &neq; alpha at a site. The estimates aggregate
information over all branches, so the signal is derived from pervasive
diversification or conservation. A subset of branches can be selected
for testing as well, in which case an additional (nuisance) parameter
will be inferred -- the non-synonymous rate on branches NOT selected for
testing. Multiple partitions within a NEXUS file are also supported for
recombination - aware analysis.
