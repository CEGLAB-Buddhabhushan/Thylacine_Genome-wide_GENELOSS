Error:Internal error 
Internal error in ComputeBranchCache (branch DxsR_Hyv.tree_0.Sminthopsis_crassicaudata, eval #1049 ) reversible model cached likelihood =   -40090.99819656119, directly computed likelihood =   -40090.91953450221. This is most likely because a non-reversible model was incorrectly auto-detected (or specified by the model file in environment variables; for smaller errors, this could be due to numerical instability of calculations for larger alignments). To treat numerical errors as warnings, please specify "ENV=TOLERATE_NUMERICAL_ERRORS=1;" as the command line argument. This often resolves the issue, which is indicative of numerical instability.
