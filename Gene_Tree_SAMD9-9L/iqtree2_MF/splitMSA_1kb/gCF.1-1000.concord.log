Host:    morpheus-OptiPlex-5050 (AVX2, FMA3, 503 GB RAM)
Command: /home/morpheus/anaconda3/bin/iqtree2 -t SAMD9-SAMD9L.PRANK.aln.treefile --gcf SAMD9-SAMD9L.1kb_window.1-1000.aln.treefile --prefix gCF.1-1000.concord
Seed:    292256 (Using SPRNG - Scalable Parallel Random Number Generator)
Time:    Fri Dec 20 14:32:27 2024
Kernel:  AVX+FMA - 1 threads (72 CPU cores detected)

HINT: Use -nt option to specify number of threads because your CPU has 72 cores!
HINT: -nt AUTO will automatically determine the best number of threads to use.

Tree with concordance factors written to gCF.1-1000.concord.cf.tree
Annotated tree (best viewed in FigTree) written to gCF.1-1000.concord.cf.tree.nex
Tree with branch IDs written to gCF.1-1000.concord.cf.branch
Concordance factors per branch printed to gCF.1-1000.concord.cf.stat
WARNING: You probably want the --scfl option. The site concordance factor
 implemented with the --scf option is based on parsimony (described here:
 https://doi.org/10.1093/molbev/msaa106). It has since been superseded by a more
 accurate likelihood-based approach which is implemented in the --scfl option, and
 is described in the paper "Updated site concordance factors minimize effects of
 homoplasy and taxon sampling" by Yu et al.. Please see the tutorial here for more
